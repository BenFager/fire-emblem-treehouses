- Bare String Test

- H: Welcome Hero, to darkness of war. Give thy love to the gods of lore?
- H: Or bolder still, together band, and strike down those who force thy hand.
- H: In fires of gods, mere mortals will quiver,
- H: The light of the moon can cause you to shiver,
- H: Or by thy hammer, forge light into peace.
- H: And with thy guidance this era may cease.

- H: Oh nevermind then. Don't worry about any of that stuff.
- P: Huh?
- H: The war ended like three years ago when the game was released.
- P: Wait, so we won already?
- H: What? Are you kidding me? The mortals didn't stand a chance!

- H: We are GODS. We shoot LIGHTNING.
- H: You guys had sticks.
- P: That can't be right.
- H: No, you're right. I misspoke.
- H: You didn't have sticks by the end of it.
- H: Universal ban on sticks, enacted by the gods.
- H: You guys were pretty annoying with them.

- H: Invented dumb stuff like spears for survival.
- H: And that weird instrument thing. Aulos?
- H: So yeah, you guys clearly weren't ready for sticks yet. So we banned them.
- H: Then we just decided to cut to the root of the problem and just banned mortals from existence.
- P: You did what?
- H: Yeah, they're all gone. It's pretty nice.
- H: So enjoy that lifespan limitation of yours.
- H: I'm not really under any obligation to do anything anymore.
- H: Game's over. Thanks for stopping by. And don't do it again.
- H: We've got our own little thing going on here, so no games please.
- H: I'll just take this and exit you out.
